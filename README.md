## How You Can Contribute
Contributions are welcome and much appreciated. To learn more, see the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/CAAPIM/Cordova-MAS-Connecta/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Generate Reference documents
The reference documents for the MAS modules are generated using the JSDoc markdown language. JSDoc reads the JS files with annotations in comments, and generates an HTML output. It considers the comments that start with /**.

To install JSDoc, follow the instructions on [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) website.

The Cordova reference documents are available at our [mas.ca.com]( http://mas.ca.com/docs/cordova/1.4.00/sdk/) site.

Example:
An annotated comment for validateOTP method is as follows:
```
 /**
  Validate the OTP.
  * @param {function} successHandler user defined success callback
  * @param {function} errorHandler user defined error callback
  * @param {string} otp user defined one-time password to verify
  */
```
**Param** – Specifies a parameter.
**{string}**  – Specifies the return type of the method.
**otp** – Specifies the variable name.
**user defined one-time password to verify** – Describes the method.

Compile the JSDoc reference document as follows:
```
jsdoc www/ -d jsdocs
```
where “www/” is the location of the js file, and “-d jsdocs” is the location where the generated reference documents are placed.

For more information about how to write and compile the JSDoc reference documents, see the [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) website.
